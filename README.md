# Groups

This is a data repository for my article named "How to discover textual groups." It includes data matrices and distance matrices for a number of example data sets:

* distances between cities
* well defined clusters
* textual variants in Mark (UBS)
* textual variants in Mark (INTF).

It also includes R scripts for analyzing the data sets and various kinds of analysis results.
